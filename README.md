# Colour palettes for better scientific visualizations
This repo contains XML files for most of the colour maps on the [SciVisColor Website](https://sciviscolor.org/). Clone or download the repo, add to your Matlab path, and start making great visualizations! The above linked website has great tips to help you get started. Feel free to download more of their colourmaps into the `cmaps/` folder. Check out the examples directory to get started.
